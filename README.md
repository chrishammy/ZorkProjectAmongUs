# ZorkProjectAmongUs
This is a very comedic take on the popular game Among Us, within a text-based format in the console. There's some unused code for more interactive NPC's, but it's a fully functioning retro-fied version of such a popular contemporary game. Hope you enjoy!

Text-based Among Us game. After running the code, you will be given a beginner prompt in the console that will prompt you to use the 'help' command to learn the gameplay commands. The game uses cardinal directions, i.e. 'go south', 'go east', etc. 

As of 1/28/2024, the game ends when either the player completes of all of their tasks, or they run out of moves, which is a randomized amount that is unknown to the player. In the future, interactions with non-player characters will replace the randomized move counter as the mechanism to make the player lose the game.
